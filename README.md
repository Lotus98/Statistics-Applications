# README 
This repository contains the applications developed for the Statistics course of the MSc in Cybersecurity at Sapienza. 

## Structure
The structure is as follows:  
Each directory contains the code of the developed application, Inside it there might different directories such as `C#/` or `VB`. These are used to distinguish the code of applications when they are required to be developed in both languages

## Release section
In the Release section can be found ZIP files that contain the folders with the full project, comprehensive of the compiled binaries.

### Notes
Yes, I know tags and releases are completely messed up, it is okay, this is not an actual software project.
I just use this space to upload online some individual applications, and have a place where code is actually readable online.
